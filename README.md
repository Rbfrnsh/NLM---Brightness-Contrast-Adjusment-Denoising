# NLM---Brightness-Contrast-Adjusment-Denoising
The two denoising methods I used in preprocessing images for a previous project are: Non-local means (NLM) and brightness contrast adjustment, to enhance the visualization results using saliency maps
#### Non-local means (NLM) 
non local means (NLM) denoising is a technique used in image processing to reduce noise in images. It works by averaging the pixel values in an image while giving more weight to pixels that are similar to the target pixel in a non-local neighborhood, rather than just considering nearby pixels. This approach is effective at preserving image details while effectively reducing noise, making it a valuable tool for improving the quality of images in various applications, including computer vision and image analysis.

### Brightness contrast adjusment
Brightness contrast adjustment denoising is not a standard denoising technique. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a specific terminology used in your context. Typically, brightness and contrast adjustments are image enhancement techniques that aim to modify the overall appearance of an image by changing its brightness and contrast levels. They are not primarily used for noise reduction.
